<h1>The Best Movies according to Kieran</h1>
<h2>These are my favourite 3 movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Craft</h3>
    <p>I like this because it reminds me of being like, 15, and chilling with Becky (RIP) and Lyno. It was a great part of my life that i look upon fondly.</p>
<h3>Salt</h3>
    <p>This is about Russian sleeper agents growing up in the USA and infiltrating the CIA and government... but the real reason I like it is because Angelina Jolie is so damn beautiful in it.</p>
<h3>Splice</h3>
    <p>Havent watched this for ages actually, might have to find it on streaming services and watch it again. It's about this Chimera and explores what makes us animal or human.</p>
